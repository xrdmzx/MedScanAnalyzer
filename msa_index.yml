abstract: In this intricate world of research and diagnostics, Medical imaging has become an essential part of disease management and standard of care. Many different technologies exist for collecting detailed information on tissue volume, such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Computed Tomography (CT), Ultrasound, and many more, each with their own unique modalities and data formatting. With billions of images being acquired each year, and the fast paced rate at which data is acquired, there is a need for a simple and efficient tool for reviewing and sorting these images. 
Medical Scan Analyzer (MSA) is a platform designed to navigate the complexities of medical imaging, ny simplifying the task of sorting and reviewing images in a lightweight, straight forward graphical user interface (GUI). Using Python and SQLite, our platform integrates user insights with data, allowing researchers to
 efficiently upload images, and organize them based on specific study criteria, disease classification, and more. Our aim was to streamline the image qualification process of medical imaging by offering a human touch to decoding the intricacies of medical imaging data.
